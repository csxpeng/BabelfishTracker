Below are the features requests we have collected so far:

# Most Wanted Features
1. ALTER Storage Procedure / Trigger / View / Function is not supported (Workaround: user can drop and recreate it alternatively);
2. MSSQL SQL Job support, something similar to PostgreSQL pg_cron or Linux cron job;
3. SSMS object explorer is not supported (Workaround: user can "new query window" instead).

# Medium Priority
1. ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION;
2. Global temp table support, like MSSQL temp table (DML looks like "create table ##temp (id int)");
3. SQL Server resource governor to limit the CPU / Memory / IO resources database by database or user by user for our SAAS ISV customer;

# Lower Priority
1. DENY permission;
2. XML data type operations, like VALUE / QUERY / EXISTS and etc;
3. EXECUTE AS USER.
